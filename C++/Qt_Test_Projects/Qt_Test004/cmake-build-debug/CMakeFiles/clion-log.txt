CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  AUTOGEN: No valid Qt version found for target Qt_Test004.  AUTOMOC, AUTOUIC
  and AUTORCC disabled.  Consider adding:

    find_package(Qt<QTVERSION> COMPONENTS Widgets)

  to your CMakeLists.txt file.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:13 (add_executable):
  Target "Qt_Test004" links to target "Qt::Widgets" but the target was not
  found.  Perhaps a find_package() call is missing for an IMPORTED target, or
  an ALIAS target is missing?
